## Introduction ##

The project involves exploring and visualizing data from boardgamegeek.com.

## Objective ##
The objective is to identify interesting trends and patterns in the data and to tell a cohesive story about the insights gained.


The project requires filtering the data to only include games published in 1950 or later with more than 25 ratings.
Additionally, the category and mechanic variables are untidy, and the cSplit() function within the splitstackshape package can be used to fix them.
The project include 6 visualizations, with each visualization accompanied by a caption and a paragraph of text explaining the interpretation and interesting insights gained.
